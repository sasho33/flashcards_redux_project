# Flashcards Challenge Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Flashcards Challenge Project! This project is designed to help you practice using Redux and Redux Toolkit to manage the state of a flashcard-style quiz app. In this app, users can create their own topics, quizzes for those topics, and flashcards for those quizzes. Users can also interact with their quizzes by flipping the flashcards over.

This README.md provides an overview of the project goals and instructions for implementing the app's Redux logic. While this project doesn't provide a step-by-step tutorial, it offers a series of open-ended requirements to guide you through the development process. Feel free to explore various approaches and use external resources such as Codecademy and the internet when needed.

## Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project are to practice using Redux and Redux Toolkit to build a flashcard quiz app. Here are the key goals:

1. **Topics:** Implement the logic to allow users to create and manage topics. Each topic should have a name and an ID. Topics are the primary categories under which quizzes and flashcards are organized.

2. **Quizzes:** Build the functionality to create and manage quizzes for specific topics. Quizzes should have a name and an associated topic ID to link them to a particular topic.

3. **Flashcards:** Develop the feature to create and interact with flashcards within quizzes. Each flashcard should have a question, an answer, and an associated quiz ID. Users should be able to flip flashcards to reveal the answer.

While the tasks are described in a specific order, you have the flexibility to implement them in a sequence that suits you best.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
